### Abstract

Wild harvest and field cultivation of medicinal plants pose major challenges. While the former threatens extinction of wild populations the latter suffers from varying environments, pests, diseases, and contamination which can compromise yield, safety, and consistency of bioactive metabolites of medicinal plants (MPs). In contrast, Controlled Environment Plant Production Systems (CEPPS), such as vertical farms or plant factories, can produce high-quality and consistent MPs by growing plants in an optimised and consistent environment. However, there is no systematic framework to identify and select MPs most suited for commercial-scale CEPPS. Here, we developed a multi-criteria decision-making framework to systematically evaluate MP species best suited for commercial CEPPS. We evaluated 77 MPs based on seven criteria spanning *plant characteristics*, *medicinal potential*, and *environmental and economic* *status*. We then ranked these MPs using a framework that combined the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Weighted Sum Model (WSM), considering input from multiple decision-makers involved in MP production and research. Based on our analysis, MPs best suited for CEPPS were those with compact growth, short harvest cycles, and broad commercial use. *Mentha Ã— piperita* (peppermint), *Salvia officinalis* (sage), and *Thymus vulgaris* (thyme) were the highest-ranking species with high horticultural compatibility, medicinal potential, and market demand. We also found trade-offs where some species with high medicinal value ranked lower due to their currently limited botanical suitability for CEPPS. Overall, our framework provides a data-driven tool for stakeholders to identify ideal MPs for CEPPS based on their specific needs.
